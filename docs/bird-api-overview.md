## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture

Bird.com follows REST principles with:

- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods for actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes for response indication
- JSON data format

### Stateless Operations

- Each API request is independent
- No session state maintained on server
- Authentication required for each request
- Idempotent operations where applicable

### Consistent Response Format

All API responses follow consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "errors": [...],
  "meta": {...}
}
```

## Integration Considerations

### Security

- API key authentication required
- HTTPS enforced for all requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Webhook signature verification

### Performance

- Pagination for large data sets
- Efficient JSON responses
- Caching recommendations
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Scalability

- High availability infrastructure
- Global API endpoints
- Load balancing
- Automatic scaling

## Next Steps
