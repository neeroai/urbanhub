# Project Brief: UrbanHub AI Agents for Customer Acquisition

## Executive Summary

UrbanHub AI Agents is a comprehensive conversational AI ecosystem built on Bird.com platform to automate UrbanHub's customer acquisition workflow. The system transforms how UrbanHub engages with potential tenants through intelligent WhatsApp/SMS conversations that handle lead qualification, warming, tour scheduling, and follow-up automation across Mexico's premium rental market.

Primary problem being solved: UrbanHub's manual lead management process cannot scale with their aggressive expansion goals, resulting in delayed responses, missed opportunities, and inefficient conversion from leads to tours to leases.

Target market: UrbanHub leasing agents, property managers, potential tenants seeking premium rental properties in Mexico City, and operations teams managing customer acquisition workflows.

Key value proposition: AI-powered conversation automation that reduces lead response time to under 5 minutes, increases tour conversion rates by 25%, and enables UrbanHub to scale their customer acquisition without proportional staffing increases.
