# URBANHUB AI AGENTS - ARCHITECTURAL PLAN

## Generated: 2025-07-22T16:24:20.062Z
## Methodology: BMAD-METHOD (Business-centric, Model-driven Agent Development)

---

## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The UrbanHub AI Agents system is a **multi-agent conversational AI platform** built on Bird.com's omnichannel messaging infrastructure. The architecture follows a **webhook-driven, stateless agent pattern** optimized for Mexican real estate customer acquisition workflows.

### Core Architectural Principles
- **Webhook-First**: All agent interactions driven by Bird.com webhook events
- **Stateless Agents**: Each interaction is independent and contextual
- **Template-Driven**: Pre-approved WhatsApp Business templates for outreach
- **Error-Resilient**: Graceful handling of API failures and rate limits
- **Multi-Channel**: Support for WhatsApp, SMS, and email channels
