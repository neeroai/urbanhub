2. **Cultural Context**: Mexican Spanish patterns and real estate terminology
3. **Conversation Templates**: Pre-built flows for different customer personas

### Phase 2: Service Integration (Current)
1. **Mockup Data Services**: Update existing services to use static data instead of APIs
2. **Bird.com Configuration**: Ensure platform is properly configured with demo data
3. **Agent Optimization**: Fine-tune conversation flows for demo scenarios

### Phase 3: Demo Preparation (Next)
1. **Presentation Setup**: Step-by-step demo execution guide
2. **Scenario Testing**: Validate all 5 conversation flows work correctly
3. **Environment Validation**: Confirm Bird.com platform connectivity

### Phase 4: Demo Execution (Today)
